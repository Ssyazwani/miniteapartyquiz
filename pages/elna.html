      Congratulations little miss fashionista.
      Thank you for organising this cute little tea party, I am honoured.
      I know we don't hang out a lot in general right now, but well that is just us.
      From you walking with the Frisbee, to our mishaps during Syahirah's wedding (please, ur hotel room is not at the high floors right T-T),
      thank you for being part of them.
     <br> I hope you are able to buy chicken nuggets by then.
      Or not, but it's okay.<br>
      I got your back alright, will always support you from right here.
      Whenever you feel sad, if you can – think of my blunders, then I think you can laugh haha.<br>
      Anyway, here is to you<br>
      Warning to him – I am going after him if he hurts you okay, he better watch out. I from NPCC... back in secondary school and I aso kill monsters... in game – 3 years of experience chey<br><br>
      Anyway, insyaAllah, you got this. Everything will be smooth sailing, amin amin.
