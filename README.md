## About

This is a **lightweight personality quiz** that I made for my friend's pre-wedding event.  
It's themed like a cozy tea party — cute, playful, and full of personal touches. 

Participants answer a few multiple-choice questions and get a fun personality result at the end.

Special pages are for guests of this party specifically.

## Tech Stack

- 🔹 HTML
- 🔹 CSS
- 🔹 JavaScript
- 🔹 Hosted with GitHub Pages

No frameworks, no backend — just pure frontend fun.


##  Why I Made This

Because it was **a simple idea to try out and it was my first time doing this so I had alot of fun**.  
If possible, I want to do more of these cute mini personalised apps for people.
It might not go in a resume, but it made people laugh at least— and that’s worth something too.


## Special Thanks

Made with love, really.
